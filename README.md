# Neuron-Predictor

## Project Overview

A web application was created using machine learning to train a model on predicting neuron types based on firing characteristics.  The data was aquired from [NeuroElectro](https://www.neuroelectro.org/) and was used to train a Gradient Boosting model from the scikit-learn library.  After training the model on 80% of the data (filtered down to the top 6 firing characteristics with the most data), it predicted the correct neuron type with 86% accuracy.

A Heroku web application was created with this model and can be accessed here: [Neuron Predictor](https://neuron-pred.herokuapp.com/)
